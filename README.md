# Ui Base

This is a collection of convenience methods that I use across my projects, building on top of elm-ui.

It's probably of limited used to anyone else, unless you agree with my colour schemes!

The contents are:

## Colors

Stuck to the US spelling for consistency with other Elm code. Names for specific RGB combinations, 
using web standard names where possible. I'm personally colour blind (really) so I use names that 
I've looked up

## Buttons

Buttons named after roles they play in the project

## Alerts

One standard alert

## OnKey

Execute methods when a key is pressed
